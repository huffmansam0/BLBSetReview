My set review of Bloomburrow

BLB Set Review

LR Rating Scale

Let's start with grounding us in some observations about the set. I'll look at the 10 2-color pairs and their signpost uncommons, as well as some other key cards to draw some general conclusions -- scope including but not necessarily limited to the themes of the 2-color pairs as well as the relevant creature types for each color and pair.

WU - 


Gold


Doing the hybrid mana commons first.


Cindering Cutthroat: C-

Most of the tribal types (Lizards, for instance) feel just slightly important. Each tribe has 3 or so cards below rare (including the uncommon land) that care about its type. But the lands care about all the major types in their color, so it's not as though you'll need to go out of your way to make those work.

Rabbit might be the most notable exception here, as it has Harvestrite Host that acts as a huge incentive to have lots of rabbits.

But I digress, my point is that yes, this is a relevant type for B and R, but that's not a huge deal.

This looks okay. Slightly above or below rate depending on whether you dealt them damage. If you don't have anything else to do on 3, you still have to run this out even if you can't get the +1/+1 counter. The color flexibility is nice, and when you get the counter this will feel pretty good. Menace helps you push damage to kill your opponent and/or trigger your other bloodthirst effects, but having to pay 2 mana for it is kind of a bummer.

Oh, and just in case you're not familiar with hybrid mana. Remember that you can play this in your UB deck just as easily as you can play it in your WR deck.


Corpseberry Cultivator: C+

This one's a little tougher to play outside of BG due to the 1(B/G)(B/G) mana cost. Comes in an is immediately a 3/4, threatening to attack as a 4/5 the next turn. Though that's probably not happening on T3 unless you go Bonecache Overseer, Cache Grab, Corpseberry Cultivator (which is a really nasty curve out and all at common/uncommon).

This consumes but doesn't generate foraging fodder. Goes well with additional copies of itself, other cards that forage, and Bonecache Overseer.

Looks like a strong little roleplayer in BG. A bit weak on T3 in most situations, but feels good to double spell it on T5 and likely attack as a 4/5 the next turn. Also quite synergistic and costed such that BG decks cast it easily, but other decks won't really want it.

Oh! Works nicely with Stocking the Pantry too. Basically turns all your forages into Clue tokens as well.

Pretty excited for this one! Grading it fairly high, but I bet you won't really have to spend high picks on it unless BG is one of the best decks in the set. Probably pick it more around the D level but feel like you got a C+ for your deck. Awesome.


Head of the Homestead: C+

Diregraf Horde anyone? Just really bummed this isn't a WR card named "Head of Mousehold" instead.

Okay, quips aside, this looks solid. Like the Cultivator, its mana cost and what it does make it most appealing to GW, though you could play it in BG or WR (just two examples). Very on-plan, 3 bodies for 1 card is good.

My biggest concerns here are that it's expensive and that the whole "3 bodies for 1 card is good" thing applies less when you don't want to get into combat with those 3 bodies, as I'm guessing you often won't in WG.

I am envisioning WG in this set as a classic go-wide strategy. Basically that means you do not want to trade or get your creatures killed. You want to build up a huge board state and then use some mass pump spell to kill your opponent. And you're sort of racing less in the direct sense of damage, but racing to build up your critical mass of creatures vs. them killing you, trying to forestall having to chump as long as possible.

But who knows, perhaps the deck has more play, more dimensions than that. My concern is basically that if you're on defense, sure, this will do a decent job of blocking, and frankly a great job of buying you some time. But your deck wins by building up a big board state, so that's more of a "don't lose" than "win".

Ultimately, I think this card is going to be quite important and desirable in WG, and less so elsewhere. I'd imagine you want 2 or 3 of these in any WG deck.


Junkblade Bruiser: D

I'm trying to find something to like about this card. It's really boring. Expend cards don't really support each other, and there's nothing to really build around. You're going to spend mana no matter what, you want to spend as much as possible anyway, and you can't just load up your curve with 4+ drops so that you can expend more often. Plus, it's just as good to expend with two 2-drops.

So what does this card have? Stats. And trample. And that's pretty much it. It is kinda big, and I suppose it might be hard to block sometimes from a threat of activation perspective.

Expend and RG seem like frontrunners for most boring archetype and least fun play patterns. Literally what it's telling you to do is tap out precombat (or, granted, during) and attack. YAWN!

But being bad at generating enjoyment doesn't necessarily mean it's bad at winning games of Magic. However, in this case I kinda think it's bad at both. Maybe it's just big enough, but I don't really get it. You can play it, but it's really tough to imagine ever being excited about this card.


Mind Drill Assailant: C+

This looks pretty good to me. With all of these (X/Y)(X/Y) cost cards, I'm basically assuming that you're in their 2c combination. That certainly doesn't have to, and sometimes won't, be the case. But so far (with the exception of the aptly named Junkblade Bruiser), all the (X/Y)(X/Y) gold commons (henceforth hybrid gold commons. gold commons? hybrid commons? IDK.) have seemed quite a bit better in their own 2c pair, this one included.

Remember as well that in a UB deck, this has no color requirements. So there, it's an easier to cast Wishcoin Crab (4 mana 2/5) with 2 upsides. At some point it becomes a 5/5, and late game it gives you a place to sink your mana.

I'm not sure how quickly you'll be hitting Threshold. But I would guess you could expect to have it online by turn 6 or 7 most of the time, assuming you're UB and you're doing at least a little work to support Threshold. A 2/5 is a really solid blocker, so it does a good job of helping you survive to the point at which all your cards get better.

Can you tell I like this card better than Junkblade Bruiser? The art is also sweet.

Really not sure how this is going to play out in the format. It hinges on a few things ... how slow is the format / how relevant are late game mana sinks? How quickly does Threshold come online? How relevant is a 2/5 for 4 mana?

These matters all vary across different formats. From what I've seen so far, I think you'll be happy with the Assailant.


Moonrise Cleric: C

I adore the bats. I've always been partial to WB as a color combo, and really like the aesthetic and theme of astro-magic space bats. Something about the cards I've seen from them so far gives me pause though. Stinks, if you will. Reeks of "this is not going to be good".

Maybe it's set after set of WB sucking ass. Maybe it's reviewing all the White commons and uncommons and being mainly impressed by the cards that support WR and WG. Maybe it's that a grindy value midrange deck doesn't want all its creatures to be understatted flyers.

But let's not pin all my concerns onto the Moonrise Cleric here. She looks okay. This one I can see more WX and BX decks playing, assuming they're heavily that color. This seems like a perfectly reasonable place to put 3 mana, if unexciting. And in WB, it's MUCH easier to cast, and has a relevant synergy piece with a free, repeatable lifegain trigger. The only question is: can you get some attacks in with this thing?

It is notable that it needs to be attacking to do the synergy thing. That means that if you need it on defense, no synergy and no life for you. Which is unfortunate because, well, you're being attacked. 

[{WE ARE FUCKING UNDER ATTACK meme}](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/384/923/135.jpg)

Bats being flyers makes me think that this is also a skies deck, like UW, and this card would support that since it wants you to be racing.

Better if you're aggressive, but looks okay, and if the deck wants to be aggressive anyway, then it's probably a C+.


Pond Prophet: B-

![Sickos](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/946/559/443)

Yes, yes, YES! HAHAHAHA! UG finally gets an actual theme! ETBs, bouncing your own creatures (Get it, because they're hopping back into your hand? I guess? Because they're frogs? Guys?)! Game actions!!! Fun!!!

This seems like an absolutely bread and butter card for the archetype. Cheap, a nice speed bump for aggro decks, and I expect will have some real things it can block. Mice, rabbits, Offspring tokens... Reasonable early, synergistic late, I love it.

A lot worse outside of UG because it's so hard to cast on turn 2. This card will be good at all points in the game, and you'll play about as many of them as you can get, so it gets a B- from me instead of a C+ despite not having that much raw power.


Seedpod Squire: C-

This one, I question. Usually the way I think about a WU skies deck is:

Evasive threats
Removal
Things to gum up the ground

You're trying to race them -- kill them in the air, stall out/remove their stronger creatures on the ground.

You're not interested in combat tricks because you don't plan to be blocked.

Aggressive creatures on the ground are a bit worse for you because you're not running combat tricks to get them through.

You're a bit more interested in defensively slanted removal than most aggro decks, because you're explicitly planning to race.

So this card tells you to turn your ground creature sideways. There are certainly times where that could happen, especially if it has some other keywords (first strike, lifelink, vigilance). But in general I am skeptical of this plan. 4 mana 3/3 flyer with what I believe will be a marginal upside, not the most exciting in today's Limited.

One thing it has going for it -- single hybrid mana cost, so a bit more flexibility there.


Tempest Angler: C

Okay, back to cards that mostly go in their own 2c pair. This card will be fine, but not crazy. Cards like this, your opponent can typically ignore for a while, and then deal with it if/when it becomes a problem.

They're also typically a lot better with trample since their whole thing is to get really big. That said, it is very on-theme, and plays really nicely with instant speed interaction.


Veteran Guardmouse: C

It's sorta huge and really hard to block, and the scry always feels tacked on but ends up doing a lot of work. Whatever triggered Valiant on this thing likely gave it +1 power, so it's often attacking as a 5 power first striker which is a big problem.

That said, you can't play too many of these and it's probably never going to be a make-or-break component of your deck.



White


Banishing Light: B

I love that it hits any nonland permanent, so go nuts Banishing your opponent's artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers. It's efficient, avoids graveyard recursion, hits anything except a land. The only instant-speed ways to deal with this that I'm seeing are either an activated ability of a creature or an instant that doesn't look very good, so it almost never gets killed by surprise, avoiding situations where they blow it up during your attacks and block your guy with a their big creature that you Banished.

In the last few sets, this would be a frontrunner for White's best common. There's just some uncertainty around how good removal will be in general in any new set.

I'd start by assuming this is good and adjust from there.


Brave-Kin Duo: C+

Relevant creature types for WR and WG, and I suspect it will go very nicely in either of those two decks. GW seems to be going wide, which is typically a context in which 1-mana creatures and ways to push incidental damage in the early game overperform. A 1-drop with relevant creature type that pushes damage will also be at home in a RW aggressive deck. Importantly, this gives a 0-mana, repeatable way to trigger Valiant. I think this card will really shine in WR and WG, probably playing like a C+/B- but will be quite a bit worse in both WU and WB, probably playing more like a D+/C-.

As a general rule, the grades in this review will assume that you are playing cards in a context that supports them. When the demands for support made by the card are high, the grade may suffer as a result. Brave-Kin Duo prefers you play it in WR or WG, but beyond that I don't think you will need to go far out of your way at all. I grade it a C+, because I believe it will perform at that level or slightly better in the decks that support it.

It is impossible for a grade to capture all the nuance of a card's evaluation. For everything else, there's reading.


Brightblade Stoat: B

No relevant creature types. In the past 5 or so years, the 2-mana 2/2 lifelink has been a top common. This one has first strike too. I think this card will be very good. It's good by itself. It's good if you're attacking or defending. It's amazing if you're racing. It's an incredible target to buff with cards like Brave-Kin Duo. Having an early creature with two great keywords is awesome for things that want to distribute buffs or +1/+1 counters later in your curve.

Any White deck will be thrilled to play this. WG seems the least obviously synergistic, but I'm sure it will do just fine there. WR has Valiant as a theme, which rewards you for playing cards that buff your creatures. This card wears buffs nicely, so while it doesn't literally have Valiant, it will play well in an aggressive deck and will play well with cards that trigger Valiant. WU seems to be a pretty standard skies strategy, with flyers that buff your non-flyers. This seems like one of the best non-flyers to buff. And finally WB has synergies with life gain.

All that said, this card doesn't need synergies to be good... but they just might make it great.


Builder's Talent: D-

So 1W for an 0/4 Wall. Then it occasionally(?) puts a +1/+1 counter on something (Whenever you play a noncreature, nonland permanent. So noncreature artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers. Food?). Finally, it buys back a noncreature, nonland permanent which also gives you a +1/+1 counter. I don't really get it. White has Banishing Light, Carrot Cake, Feather of Flight, and this card at common/uncommon. So you're looking largely to your other color(s) to make this work.

It's this weird, defensive, grindy value card. It wants you to have some way to get a noncreature, nonland card into your graveyard. There are a few artifacts that sacrifice themselves. You could also mill yourself with Green and make foods to trigger Level 2.

On the whole, this looks like a lot of work to get a pretty minimal reward. You can't just fill your deck up with noncreature, nonland permanents. And if you did, what would you put the +1/+1 counters on? Your 0/4 defender?

I will certainly try to make this card do something at some point, but it does not look good to me.


Carrot Cake: C

** TODO: Is there any creature sacrifice?

WG is the most obvious home for Carrot Cake. Rabbits give that away, as the WG tribe. WG uses every part of the card well -- you care about Rabbits, you like going wide, and some Green cards Forage (sacrifice a Food or exile 3 cards from your GY for some benefit).

WB also has some Forage, and cares about life gain. [creature sacrifice comment goes here]

A bit slow, clunky, and defensive for WR's taste. Not bad in WU -- your skies deck will be happy for some chumpers and a life buffer.

Definitely will depend a bit on the texture of your deck. Going wide? Foraging? Sacrificing creatures? Carrot Cake.


Dewdrop Cure: D-

Cards like this tend to be hard to make work in Limited. The trouble is, it's hard to get so many valid targets into the GY for it. And this one is so narrow -- Creatures that cost 2 or less. If you're WG or WB, maybe you can be milling yourself. But how many creatures that cost 2 or less are you really playing? 5 to 9? Even at 10, you'd have to mill about 8 cards on average to hit 2. Though often hitting 1 will be enough, as getting 1 into the GY by natural means is not so terribly hard.

But by the time you've done the work to set this up, I question how relevant two 1 or 2-drops will really be. Also, note that you'll rarely want to give your opponent a card for the 3rd worst 1 or 2-drop in your graveyard.

If you have some 1 or 2 mana bomb, I could start to be coaxed Dew-ward. But I'm really not a believer in this card on first read. A cowardly, non-committal grade would be something like a D. I'm going F. I would not recommend it.

Update: Okay, I don't think this card is an actual 0. But it's very narrow and most of the time you shouldn't play it. Grade updated to D-.

Speaking about this card with a friend, we did come up with one scenario where it would be good. Bo3, you're on a very low curve aggro deck, your opponent is playing a ton of removal. So you could sideboard it in that situation, wahoo!


Driftgloom Coyote: C+

I want this card topping the curve in my aggro deck. I've already been pressuring their removal. Maybe I have already presented bigger threats. Removing the creature during my turn is at the very least pushing damage.

In that scenario, I see this feeling like a B-/B. But I don't love the card. You're on the back foot. You play this. You get rid of their best creature. How are you feeling? Really hoping they don't kill this thing. Oh no, they've attacked into it with their 3/3 and 5 open mana. Am I really blocking? Crap.

I can't be too hard on it though. Especially if you have ways to protect it or are planning to really be applying pressure, this card can go pretty hard. But it feels a bit fragile, and quite expensive.


Feather of Flight: C-

To me, cards like this typically look a bit better than they play. Unlike most of them, this has flash. That changes matters a bit.

- Ambush their flyer (dangerous)
- Trigger Valiant at instant speed (cool)
- Win a tight combat (Their 2/3 blocks your 2/3. Probably won't come up that often.)
- Trigger Expend X at instant speed in your WR/WG deck (wicked)

Still, I'm hesitant. 2 mana feels like a lot for this effect. Usually I'd give this sort of thing a D/D+, but I'm going to start this a little bit higher because flash is good.


Flowerfoot Swordmaster: B-

There's an idea of secret gold cards. Cards that only have one colored mana requirement in their casting cost, but are so geared toward a specific 2-color pair that they may as well be gold for the purposes of your drafting evaluation. This is one of them.

This looks pretty sick to me in your mice aggro deck. Really good on 1 or 3. It's a WR card -- you want 10+ mice, but if you've got em, this thing pops off. Avoid playing this outside of WR, and dock it in the same way you might any gold card before you know you're WR w/ lots of mice.

My only hesitation is that the gameplan this card envisions is a little bit fragile. If you opponent can get set up with a burly blocker or two, it might be hard for such little guys to get through, even with some bumps to their power. Hard to say how that will play out.

Very high ceiling, but a low floor as well.


Harvestrite Host: B

Secretly a WG gold card. If you happened to be really heavy White and have a ton of the relevant creature type, of course you can play this.

This looks like an awesome payoff and engine card for WG rabbits. Lots of cards make multiple rabbits in one shot, on top of simply double spelling. And this thing keeps itself rolling. All that paired with a relevant stat line at 3/3 and adding pressure to the board with the +1/+0, and this thing looks like a house and a must-kill for your opponent.

Consider saving it until you can double-spell it with another rabbit.


Hop to It: C+

** TODO: Is there creature sacrifice?

Looks great for WG and acceptable for everyone else.


Lifecreed Duo: C

Relevant types for WU and WB. Looks solid in those decks, acceptable in WG, and at its worst in WR. Your 2-drop swinging life total by 2-3 per turn in a manner that's difficult to interact with is decent. Guaranteeing that your life gain synergies are online is good too. And effects that deal damage and gain life tend to shine when racing. Skies decks (WU) tend to be racing you, so I expect the ability to go nicely there. Still feels a bit low impact on the whole, trending toward C- for me.


Mabel's Mettle: C

Two Valiant triggers on one card. Really tough to say how this is going to line up in the format in general. Will it often win you two combats? If so, it sounds great in any ground-based aggressive deck. If you have a heavy Valiant theme, this seems great. RW tends to be ground aggro, combat tricks are important to that style of deck, AND it majorly enables your synergies at instant speed.

I'm only really excited about this in RW. And I doubt you'll ever have to spend a high pick on it. Note that in RW, it might perform like a C+/B-. In every other White deck, I think this will play closer to D+/C-. Though as with the other secret gold cards, White itself has Valiant, so if you're just heavy White, are expecting your creatures to attack and be blocked, and have some Valiant, I expect this to be at home in your deck.


Mouse Trapper: C-

3/2 for 3 is typically a rough stat line. Trades down, dies to 1 mana removal. Flash means you more often get one turn of this card doing its thing before it bites the dust.

This feels pretty awkward to me. You're only ever triggering it once. Triggering it during your opponent's turn seems hard and bad (because you're precombatting a combat trick). It also doesn't play well with your combat tricks (unlike a lot of Valiant cards), so it's a lot more interested in the Valiant triggerers that are good at sorcery speed.

That said, a repeatable, 0-mana tapper with relevant creature type could definitely be scary. Confidence level on this one is pretty low, and I don't doubt that there will be games where this card absolutely rips me in half. But on the whole, I'm not loving the look of it.


Nettle Guard: C+

Tough to block 3/1 that you can cash in for a Naturalize. Relevant creature type, plays well with all the Valiant stuff. And great threat of activation on this one. You really want incidental ways to trigger Valiant on this one. Things that cycle or are tacked on to other cards. Mabel's Mettle, for instance. Feather of Flight goes crazy on this card too. They block it with their 2/2 "At least it will trade for their combat trick!" BANG! Feather of Flight, +1/+2. You win the combat, you draw a card, you have a 4/1 flyer with upside. Nice.


Parting Gust: C+

Love the silly art.

Oh man, this one is tough. Hard removal that gives them a tapped (important) fish, or a blink. I think this is pretty good. In recent sets, Blue enchantments that turn stuff into a 1/1 no text has been decent. There, you'd often use it as a combat trick. Here, you can't do that, but you also don't want to when you're aggressive and generally feel less pressured to. Don't want to when aggressive because you'd just rather push damage, which this card lets you do because the fish is tapped. Don't need to in general because the creature is already exiled, so you're not scared of them bouncing it or removing the enchantment making it a 1/1.

If you have ETBs, awesome, but I'd mostly expect the other half of this card to play out as a protection spell for your creatures.

So a removal / save your creature split card. That seems quite good. My biggest problem is the WW cost. Means you have to be more committed to White, and makes it hard to double spell and hold this up during their turn.

If you have 10+ White sources in your deck, I expect this to play out around C+/B- level. You can play it with less, it's helped by being good late game when you're likely to have WW, but it will be a bit worse. I'm very nervous at 7 White sources, I'm cutting it at 6.


Pileated Provisioner: C+

Looks like a WU card, right? It's a bird, it does the "creatures without flying" thing that WU does. Nahhh. This thing has WR and WG written all over it. Basically you want this to pump all your creatures, which means you need them to not have flying. WR is a ground-based aggro deck with some go-wide stuff happening. Perfect. WG is going even wider and seems largely ground based. Also awesome. If you're getting 2 or more +1/+1 counters, this card is going to feel awesome. If you're WG and have dumped 6 rabbits onto the board, you're going to be hopping for joy.

I like it a bit less in WU just because you're probably getting less out of the ETB, but it's probably not terrible. WB also has a lot of flyers, but I don't yet understand what WB is doing all that well. I may update this later if I understand better.


Rabbit Response: C

Aha, here it is. The payoff for making all those rabbits. I feel like I'm saying this a lot, but I expect this to be at its best in WG > WR >>> WU > WB.

It's not so much the Scry 2, though that is nice, it's just that this is exactly what a dedicated go-wide deck needs to close out a game. You probably want to play 2 of these, maybe 3. But you'll also probably get them late if you're the WG drafter because other decks won't use them as well as you.

This is a weird one to grade. In WG, it's likely an essential component of the deck. But you want ~2.5 of them, leaning toward 2. WR it probably plays out like a C. I'm going to give it a C, but the grade really doesn't tell you much on this one.


Repel Calamity: B

A little better in Bo3, but this card is just awesome. 2 mana to kill something you care about. Probably never cutting this from a White deck. Instant speed so you can catch something when they buff it temporarily, giving it a lot more game against WR and WG. Hinging on power OR toughness is a big game too. And the art is sweet. Pick it highly and play it.


Seasoned Warrenguard: B-

For someone tasked with guarding the warren, this gal sure sucks on defense. But it sure can beat down. With Carrot Cake, Offspring, and general rabbit token generation, she will attack as a 3/2 without too much trouble. Works with Food tokens too.

I don't know about this one. It looks pretty good, but I quite dislike cards that are so one-dimensionally aggressive. Even in your aggro decks, sometimes your opponent puts you on the back paw and the Warrenguard really suffers there. That said, she contributes beautifully to an aggressive gameplan. Creates a ton of pressure, sneaks in some damage early to soften them up for your big Rabbit Response alpha strike later on.

And a good way to not be put on defense is to curve out a really aggressive 1, 2, 3, which the Warrenguard here is happy to help you out with.

On the whole, I predict this card will be part of some of the strongest, scariest starts. And it feels so on-plan in WR and WG, so a pretty good grade feels appropriate.


Shrike Force: B-

A reasonable baseline. Vigilant flying 2/3. If you can suit this up and protect it, it will feel very oppressive. I just wish it were a mouse! And birds typically buff things without flying, so there are a couple things working against it from a synergy viewpoint. But it doesn't need any help to be acceptable, and with just a little help it gets out of hand fast.


Star Charter: 

TODO: o:"1 damage", how often can you trigger


Thistledown Players: D+

TODO: o:{T}

How are you making this better than 3/3 make something Vigilant? Maybe you're precombatting something and using this to generate a mana to double spell. Maybe you've got some sweet {T}: abilities.


Warren Elder: C+

Looks solid, but not super impressive. It's a Plan B. Plan A is Rabbit Response. +2/+1 is so much better than +1/+1. But you do need plenty of 2-drops in your White deck, and this one is fine. There is some nice threat of activation here, making it tough to block you on 4 mana.

For me to be really excited about this for WG, I'd want it to make two creatures or do a better job of pushing damage early.

You will feel pressured by this thing if it's sitting around, and later in the game the threat of double activation becomes real too. That won't come up much, though.

Overall feels quite mediocre to me, but I expect you'll see it on the battlefield all the time. If 2-drop creatures end up being very easy to come by, bump this down a bit. I'm basically only giving it a C+ (instead of a C) because it's a 2-drop and those are going to be very important in your White decks.


Wax-Wane Witness:
